## Versioning Rules (Semantic Versioning)

- **Patch** (`A.B.C+1`): backward-compatible bug fix — confirm the fix is merged to `main`
- **Minor** (`A.B+1.0`): backward-compatible new feature — confirm all feature work is on `main`
- **Major** (`A+1.0.0`): breaking change — requires migration notes in the release description
- Version is **never set manually** in project files; it flows from git tags via GitVersion
- GitVersion 5.x syntax only: use `tag`, not `label`; use standard branch names, not `is-main-branch`

## Dependency Management Rules

- All package versions live in `Directory.Packages.props` — never set `Version` in individual `.csproj` files
- When updating a dependency, edit only `Directory.Packages.props`
- After any dependency update, run `dotnet restore` and then the full test suite
- When adding a new dependency, add `PackageVersion` to `Directory.Packages.props` and `PackageReference` (without version) to the relevant `.csproj`

## Testing Standards

- Test runner: NUnit 4 via `dotnet test` from repo root
- Coverage target: ≥96% line, ≥93% branch (last measured baseline)
- Test fixture classes must be `public` for reliable VS Code Test Explorer discovery
- Run `dotnet test` before every release and after every dependency update
- To check coverage: `dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"`

## Release Workflow (Summary)

1. Confirm all changes are merged to `main` and CI is green
2. Choose the next SemVer based on the change type (patch / minor / major)
3. For major releases: ensure breaking changes are documented and migration notes are ready
4. In GitHub: create a new Release with tag `vX.Y.Z` targeting `main`
5. Publishing the release triggers the `publish-nuget.yml` workflow automatically
6. Monitor the Actions run; verify the package appears on nuget.org

## Examples Project Rules

- Example projects reference the local `.nupkg`, not nuget.org
- Use `scripts/rebuild-package-and-examples.ps1` to regenerate local pack and restore examples
- Example projects live under `Examples/` and have their own `Directory.Build.props` and `Directory.Packages.props`
- Do NOT change the target feed in example `nuget.config` to nuget.org

## Package Metadata Location

All public package metadata is in `Directory.Build.props`:

- `Description`, `PackageTags`, `PackageLicenseExpression`, `PackageProjectUrl`, `PackageIcon`, `PackageReadmeFile`
- `README.md` at the repo root is embedded as the NuGet readme
- `Docs/logo.png` is embedded as the package icon

## How to Behave

- Always read the relevant file before modifying it
- When asked to prepare a release, walk through the full checklist from `release-process.md`
- When updating dependencies, always verify with `dotnet restore` and `dotnet test` after
- When changing package metadata, edit `Directory.Build.props` (not the `.csproj`)
- Prefer `multi_replace_string_in_file` for batched edits to the same file
- Surface CI/CD failures with context — check workflow YAML and GitVersion config before guessing
- Do not push, create tags, or publish releases without explicit user confirmation
